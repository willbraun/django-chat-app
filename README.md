This is a messaging app where users can communicate with each other in chat rooms. I used React for the front end and Django for the backend. I made it themed around Greenville, SC, where I currently live.

Features
- User registration and authorization
- Send a message to an existing room
- Edit a message
- Delete a message
- Create a new room
- The app will check for new messages in the room you have selected so that if someone else sends a message to the room, you will see it.
